# Work-Day-Scheduler

This webpage is a daily planner. When a user loads the page, it displays the current time, and a series of hour-blocks (one for each hour of the standard work day) where the user can enter tasks. Each of these hour blocks is color coded to indicate whether they are in the past, present, or future. When a user clicks on a block, they are able to enter or edit the tasks in that block. They can then press the block's corresposponding save button to commit the block's text to local storage. The next time they load the page, any saved tasks will persist.
